Introduction to Angular
=======================

        - Angular is the javascript framework.

        - Angular given by Google.

        - Angular used to build the both web applications and mobile applications.

        - Angular categorized into 3 types.

                1) AngularJS

                2) Angular2

                3) Angular Material

        - AngularJS used to build the web applications with the help of javascript.

        - javascript is the Scripting language.

        - javascript won't follows the OOPS.

        - javascript is the object based Scripting language.

        - current version of Angular2 is Angular12.

        - we can build the Angular12 applications with the help of TypeScript.

        - TypeScript is the programming language provided by microsoft.

        - TypeScript follows the OOPS.

            Ex.
                    Inheritance

                    Polymorphism

                    Anstraction

                    Encapsulation

                    ---
                    ---
                    ---
         - Angular Material used to apply the styles to the both web applications and mobile applications.

        - in general browsers can't understand TypeScript.

        - so, we must convert TypeScript to equalent javascript.

        - conversion from TypeScript to equalent javascript called as "Transpilation".

        - tsc is the tool, used to perform the Transpilation.

        - tsc stands for TypeScript Compiler.

        - tsc tool, available in "TypeScript" Software.

        - npm is the tool, helps to install TypeScript.

        - npm stands for node packaging manager.

        - npm present in NodeJS.

        - Visual Studio Code is the suggestable IDE to build the Angular applications.

        - Visual Studio Code also called as VSCode.

        - VSCode is the open source IDE, and provided by microsoft.

Installation of Softwares
*************************

1) download and install NodeJS.

    - npm is the tool, helps to install "TypeScript" and "Angular12".

    - npm stands for node packaging manager.

    - npm present in NodeJS.

    website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    file    : node-v14.17.6-x64.msi



2) install TypeScript

    > npm i -g typescript

    i stands for install

    -g stands for global


3) install yarn tool

    yarn tool used to download the libraries.

    yarn tool given by "facebook".

    > npm i -g yarn


4) install angular12


    > npm install -g @angular/cli


    cli stands for command line interface

    cli is the tool.

    cli tool, helps to "build" and "execute" the angular applications.



5) configure the yarn tool to cli tool

    > ng config --global cli.packageManager yarn


6) install Visual Studio Code


website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.60.2.exe


create and execute the angular application
******************************************
1) create the angular application

    > ng new firstApp

    where "firstApp" is the name of the angular application


2) switch to angular application

    > cd firstApp

3) execute the angular application

    > ng s -o

    "s" stands for serve

    "-o" stands for open the default browser


Default Port Number Angular application is 4200


Directory Structure of Angular application
******************************************

1) node_modules

    node_modules containes libraries, those libraries helps to execute the angular application


2) src/app

    used to deploy the applications

    Ex.
        components

        services

        directives

        pipes

        ----
        ----
        ----

3) src/app/app.module.ts

    this file called as registration file / module file / configaration file

    this file used to register the applications

        components

        services

        directives

        pipes

        ----
        ----
        ----

4) app.component.ts
   app.component.html
   app.component.css
   app.component.spec.ts


        when ever we create the angular application automatically "AppComponent" is the default component.


5) assets

    it is used to deploy the static resources.

    Ex.
        logos

        xml files

        json files

        ----
        ----
        ----


5) environments

    used to configure the required environment to work on angular application


6) favicon.ico

    this is a default logo of angular.


7) index.html

    angular starts the execution from "index.html" file.

    index.html file is the main template

    index.html file internally invokes the main.ts file

    main.ts file internally invokes the app.module.ts file

    app.module.ts file containes our applications configarations

    based on our applications configarations angular framework will execute our applications.


8) polyfills.ts

    polyfills behaves like library

    this library helps to convert the TypeScript to equalent javascript.


9) styles.css

    styles.css file used to define the global styles.

    these styles applicable to entire angular project.


10) test.ts

    test.ts behaves like library

    this library helps to write the test cases.


11) .browserslistrc

    containes supporting browsers of angular.

12) .editorconfig

    related to VSCode

13) .gitignore  

    stops the pushing the libraries to repositories


14) angular.json

    used to describe the directory structure of angular application



15) karma.conf.js

    acting like library file to write unit test cases.


16) package.json

    used to download the libraries.


Component
*********
    - Reusable Portion of Complex UI Called as Component.

    - As a Angular Developer, we can create more than one component.

    - we can reuse the components.

    - as a angular developer, we can provide communication between compoenents.

    - Simple typescript class behaves like component.

steps to create the first component
===================================

1) create the angular application

    > ng new componentApp

        where "componentApp" is the name of the angular application


    **********************************************
   componentApp
              src  
                app
                  first.component.ts
                  first.component.html


                  app.module.ts
                index.html
    **********************************************


services
********
    services are used to share the common business logic to multiple compoenents

    services overcomes the data redundancy.

    we can inject service to the compoenents with the help of constructor.

    injecting service to compoenents called as dependency injection.

    "Injectable" is the Predefined class used to create the services.

    Injectable present in @angular/core package.

          app.module.ts
        index.html


communication between compoenents
*********************************
    angular applications are component based applications

    we can create more than one component

    as a angular developer, we can provide communication between compoenents.

    we can provide communication between compoenents in 4 ways.

    1) @Input()

    2) @Output()

    3) @ViewChild()

    4) @ViewChildren()




06-10-2021
**********
steps to provide communication from parent compoenent to child child compoenent

1) create the angular application

    > ng new InputAndOutputEx

2) switch to project

    > cd InputAndOutputEx

3) create the ParentComponent

    > ng g c components/parent --skip-tests -is --flat true --selector=parent

        g stands for genarate

        c stands for component

        --skip-tests menas skip the unit test cases

        -is means inline styles and skip the external css files

        --flat true skip the additional folder creation

        --selector used to assign the selector

4) create the child component

    > ng g c components/child --skip-tests -is --selector=child --flat true

5) map the "ParentComponent" data to "ChildComponent"

    parent.component.html

6) bootstrap the ParentComponent

    app.module.ts


data from child compoenent to parent component
==============================================
1) define event in ChildComponent

    => EventEmitter is Utility class, used to share the data from child compoenent to ParentComponent.


2) fire the EventEmitter.


3) map the child compoenent data to parent compoenent

    parent.component.html




@ViewChild()   && @ViewChildren()
---------------------------------

    - above directives used to get the reference from one compoenent to another compoenent


step 1.
    create the SecondComponent

        > ng g c components/second --skip-tests -is --selector=second --flat true


step 2.
    create the FirstComponent

    > ng g c components/first --skip-tests -is --selector=first --flat true


Pipes
*****
    format the data accroding "application" presentation.

    we have two types of pipes.

        1) Predefined Pipes

        2) Custom Pipes

    the pipes provided by angular framework called as Predefined Pipes.

    the pipes developed by us based on application requirement called as Custom Pipes.



Rest API Call
*************

1) execute the spring boot application

2) test the rest api call with "Postman" / "Browser"

        http://localhost:5000/api/v1/products    (GET Request)

3) create the angular application

    > ng new springBootIntegration

4) create the service

    >  ng g s spring --skip-tests --flat true

5) create the component

    AppComponent



Forms
*****

1) Template Driven Forms

        - Main Forms Logic available in templates

        - These forms are difficult to build "complex forms"


2) Model Driven Forms / Reactive Forms


Directives
**********
    Directives enhances the "views" capabilities.

    we have two types of directives

        1) Predefined Directives

        2) Custom Directives

    The Directives given by angular framework called as "Predefined Directives".

    The Directives Developed by us called as Custom Directives.


Directives internally categorized into 3 types
**********************************************

1) Attribute type directives      ----      []

2) event based directives          -----      events    Ex. click, dblclic, keydown,.....    ()

3) structural based directives         ------   "*"
                                       -----   *ngFor
                                               *ngIf



Single Page Applications
++++++++++++++++++++++++

    - loading one component to another component without refreshing the whole webpage called as Single Page Application.

    - navigation in single page application called as "Routing".

    - we will implement single page applications with the help of "RouterModule"

steps to implement the Single Page Application
**********************************************

1) create the angular application

    > ng new spaDemo1

2) switch to angular application

    > cd spaDemo1

3) create the components

    > ng g c master --skip-tests -is --flat true --selector=master

    > ng g c pageone --skip-tests -is --flat true --selector=pageone

    > ng g c pagetwo --skip-tests -is --flat true --selector=pagetwo

    > ng g c pagethree --skip-tests -is --flat true --selector=pagethree



4) implement the Routing

    /page_one ===> PageoneComponent

    /page_two ===> PagetwoComponent

    /page_three ===> PagethreeComponent

    *************************************
    spaDemo1
           src
             app
               routing
                  app.routes.ts
    ************************************

5) load the routes

    app.module.ts






Lazy Loading
************

1) collect the cloud images path

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p1.jpg

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p2.jpg

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p3.jpg

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p4.jpg

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p5.jpg

    https://mernclassbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/p6.jpg


2) store above images path to "mysql" database

    password : admin

    database name : ng6pm

    table name : products

    host : localhost


implement the backend
*********************
    implement the backend to interact with the database


1) create the directory

    Ex.
        backend

2) switch to backend directory

    > cd backend

3) download the libraries

    => mysql
        "mysql library" used to connect to the mysql database

    => express
        "express library" used to develop the rest apis.
                GET
                POST
                PUT
                DELETE
                ---
                ---
                ---

    => cors
        "cors" library used to enable the cors policy


    Ex.
        npm i mysql express cors

            (or)

        yarn add mysql express cors


    all the libraries downloads to node_modules folder.


4) implement the rest api

    server.js
